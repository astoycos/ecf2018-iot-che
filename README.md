# EclipseCon France 2018 â€“ IoT cloud development with Che

This repository contains the resources for my talk "IoT cloud development with Che"
at [EclipseCon France 2018](https://www.eclipsecon.org/france2018/).

**Note**: The setup is targeted to a node with a specific hostname. So it will contain
some specific IP addresses and hostnames which need to be replaced when replicating
the setup. 

Clone this repository with `--recursive` or `--recursive-submodules`
in order to fetch all submodules during the initial clone.
